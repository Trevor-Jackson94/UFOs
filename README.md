# UFO Analysis
## Overview
Developed a webpage exhibiting UFO sighting data contained in a Javascript object file. Used Javascript coding language, HTML, and Bootstrap for the webpage styling template. 

## Results
The webpage (Figure 1) was developed to detail UFO sightings contained in the javascript object within the data.js file. The webpage was developed with HTML in conjunction with Javascript to organize the javascript object into a table and enable the filtering feature that is seen on the webpage. Using the index.html file you can apply a filter on the date of the sighting, the city, state, and country the sighting occurred in, as well as the shape of the UFO sighting.

## Summary
A few items for improvement with the developed webpage include:
1 - The webpage could also filter on duration and possibly comments.
2 - The styling is still a little bit bland and some of the organization of the webpage could be better organized, especially with the header and intro paragraph sections.

A couple ways to improve and further develop the data and webpage include:
1 - You could have a clickable part of each UFO sighting entry that redirects you to a search on the topic or another webpage with more information.
2 - Expanding on the first point, you could even pull information using web scraping from another sight that has more details regarding these sightings to incorporate into the table.
